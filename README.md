# Breast Cancer Detection using SVM and KNN

---

Hello and welcome to TDS. My name is Mr. Bright and I’ll be your instructor for this project. In this project, we’ll build a practical machine-learning solution for breast cancer detection, training and comparing classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) — and I’ll explain why these algorithms are suitable for this problem.

We’ll use the Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (also available on Kaggle), which contains 699 instances and 11 attributes. I will walk you through each line of code so you understand what it does and why it’s necessary.

We’ll start by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset. Then we will perform preprocessing and exploratory data analysis with histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and a correlation heatmap to get familiar with the features and their relationships.

After preparing the data, we’ll train the KNN and SVM models to predict whether a cell is benign (label 2) or malignant (label 4). In an example run, KNN achieved about 97% accuracy and SVM about 98%.

Finally, we’ll compare model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices to see how many benign and malignant samples were correctly and incorrectly classified.

This is an excellent project to learn classification techniques and model evaluation — let’s get started.
